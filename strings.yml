      "AZ Web Devs is a community created by and for local web developers, as a place for us to
      connect, communicate and collaborate. This community aims to be a great
      place to chat and get help or advice, for those of us who attend every
      possible meetup and those who can't attend any—and everyone in between."

      description:
        "Many local developers don't have time to attend meetups, or simply
        can't go as often as they'd like to, or live too far away from ones they
        would like to attend. For these reasons, we created this community, so
        more developers can network with each other. This community is less formal
        than the various Meetup groups, and we don't (yet) have any regular meetings.
        It's more just a place to gather and chat, collaborate, get help, offer help,
        advice, network, etc. Join us and meet more devs!"
